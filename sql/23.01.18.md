## 학습내용
1. outer join
2. subquery
3. Single Row Subquery
4. Mulit Row Subquery
5. mulit column subquery
6. inlineview
6. sql 과제



### Outer Join
```
INSERT INTO c_emp VALUES(201,'신입1',1500,'3429-0100',null);
INSERT INTO c_emp VALUES(202,'신입2',1500,'3429-0200',null);

select c.name 이름, s.dept_name 부서명 from c_emp c, s_dept s where c.dept_id = s.id; // null의 연산은 항상 false라 신입이 출력 안된다

select c.name 이름, s.dept_name 부서명 from c_emp c, s_dept s where c.dept_id = s.id(+); 신입사원까지 출력() //outer join

```

조건에 일치하는 데이터만 출력하는것이 아닌 조건에 해당하지 않는 데이터도 null로 처리하여 출력한다.





### Subquery

```
select c.id 사번, c.name 이름
from c_emp c
where c.dept_id = ( select dept_id from c_emp c where c.name = '이순신');
```

sql문에 또 다른 sql문을 추가하여 원하는 결과를 가져온다.	




### Single Row Subquery
```
select
name 이름, dept_id 부서아이디
from c_emp 
where dept_id = (select id from s_dept  where dept_name IN('총무부', '영업부'));

error : single-row subquery returns more than one row
//서브쿼리의 결과가 여러개이기에 에러 발생
```
서브 쿼리의 결과가 한개인 쿼리를 Single Row Subquery라 한다.

### Mulit Row Subquery
```
select
name 이름, dept_id 부서아이디
from c_emp 
where dept_id IN (select id from s_dept  where dept_name IN('총무부', '영업부'));

```
서브쿼리의 결과가 여러개인 쿼리를 Mulit Row Subquery라 한다


3. Multi Column Subquery

  ```
  select 
  name, salary, dept_id
  from c_emp
  where (salary, dept_id) IN (select MIN(salary), dept_id from c_emp group by c_emp.dept_id);
  ```

  여러개의 컬럼들을 검색하는 서브쿼리

  

4. Inline View

```
select MIN(salary), dept_id 
from c_emp c (select dept_id, MIN(salary) min from c_emp group by dept_id) vt
where c.dept_id = vt.dept_id and c.salary = vt.min;
```

from절에서 서브쿼리를 통해 사용자 임의의 가상 테이블을 만들어 사용한다.




### 과제

```
select * from tab; //내가 가지고있는 테이블을 보여줌
